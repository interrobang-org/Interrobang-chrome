# Interrobang Chrome
Information retrieval made easy and fun. Interrobang aims to motivate you to better pick and read through web pages by giving you a handful of intriguing questions. The questions are formed out of the summarized version of the lengthy text which may or may not be something you would like to dig into.

## As a web browser extension
You visit a website where there is a list of links with titles. Interrobang visits the websites in advance to tell you what's inside the link. It works in the background so that your browsing experience is not as much affected as possible.

## Playground
You can also experiment the power of our information retrieval system in playground. Click `option` of chrome extension and you will see both the summary and questions according to what you type as input.
